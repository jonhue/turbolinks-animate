## Usage

**[How to migrate to version 2](MIGRATING.md)**

First you need to add [turbolinks-animate.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/turbolinks-animate), and its dependencies to your project

**ES6:**

```javascript
import 'turbolinks-animate';
```

**ES5:**

```javascript
require('turbolinks-animate');
```

Then initialize it:

```javascript
document.addEventListener( 'turbolinks:load', function() {
    TurbolinksAnimate.init();
});
```

By default the `body` element is being used for animating page transitions. If you want to just transition specific parts of your views, you can specify an alternate element:

```javascript
document.addEventListener( 'turbolinks:load', function() {
    TurbolinksAnimate.init({ element: document.querySelector('main') });
});
```

**Note:** You can only use `TurbolinksAnimate.init()` for one element at a time.

In versions < 2, you were able to set custom listeners for `appear` and `disappear` animations. To restore the old behavior set the `customListeners` [options](#options) to `true`.

### Functions

```javascript
// Shows the initialized element
TurbolinksAnimate.appear();

// Hides the initialized element
TurbolinksAnimate.disappear();
```

### Options

There are a number of ways in which you can adopt turbolinks-animate.js to your needs:

#### Animations:

The vital part is choosing an animation to play. turbolinks-animate.js utilizes Animate.css to power them. These are the animations which are currently accessible:

* `fadeIn`
* `fadeInUp`
* `fadeInDown`
* `fadeInRight`
* `fadeInLeft`
* `fadeInUpBig`
* `fadeInDownBig`
* `fadeInRightBig`
* `fadeInLeftBig`
* `fadeOut`
* `fadeOutUp`
* `fadeOutDown`
* `fadeOutRight`
* `fadeOutLeft`
* `fadeOutUpBig`
* `fadeOutDownBig`
* `fadeOutRightBig`
* `fadeOutLeftBig`
* `bounceIn`
* `bounceInUp`
* `bounceInDown`
* `bounceInRight`
* `bounceInLeft`
* `bounceOut`
* `bounceOutUp`
* `bounceOutDown`
* `bounceOutRight`
* `bounceOutLeft`
* `flipInX`
* `flipInY`
* `flipOutX`
* `flipOutY`
* `lightSpeedIn`
* `lightSpeedOut`
* `rotateIn`
* `rotateInDownLeft`
* `rotateInDownRight`
* `rotateInUpRight`
* `rotateInUpLeft`
* `rotateOut`
* `rotateOutDownLeft`
* `rotateOutDownRight`
* `rotateOutUpRight`
* `rotateOutUpLeft`
* `rollIn`
* `rollOut`
* `zoomIn`
* `zoomInUp`
* `zoomInDown`
* `zoomInRight`
* `zoomInLeft`
* `zoomOut`
* `zoomOutUp`
* `zoomOutDown`
* `zoomOutRight`
* `zoomOutLeft`
* `slideInUp`
* `slideInDown`
* `slideInRight`
* `slideInLeft`
* `slideOutUp`
* `slideOutDown`
* `slideOutRight`
* `slideOutLeft`

There are three ways in which you can specify the animation you want to use. To choose a globally used animation pass an option when initializing turbolinks-animate.js:

```javascript
TurbolinksAnimate.init({ animation: 'fadeinright' });
```

**Note:** The option falls back to `fadein`.

**Note:** As a global choice you would only want to use appearing animations, as they will get fade out automatically when the current view disappears.

For alternate approaches take a look at [inline animations](#inline-animations) and animations [overriding animations](#overriding-animations).

#### Options:

* `duration` CSS value for `animation-duration`. Accepts a string. Defaults to `0.3s`.

* `delay` Milliseconds after which animation starts. Accepts an integer or `false`. Defaults to `false`.

* `reversedDisappearing` Whether or not a reversed animation should be used when disappearing. Accepts a boolean. Defaults to `false`.

* `breakpoints` An array of breakpoint objects to specify breakpoints used for [Per Device-Type animations](#per-device-type). Accepts an array. Defaults to: `[{ name: 'mobile', width: 500 },{ name: 'tablet', width: 1024 },{ name: 'desktop', width: 1440 }]`

* `customListeners` Restore the behavior of versions < 2 to set custom listeners to run `appear()` and `disappear()` functions. Accepts a boolean. Defaults to `false`.

#### Example:

```javascript
TurbolinksAnimate.init({ animation: 'fadeinright', duration: '1s', delay: 1000 });
```

### Inline animations

With turbolinks-animate.js you are able to set animations based on the links, who got clicked:

```html
<a href="" data-turbolinks-animate-animation="fadeout" data-turbolinks-animate-duration="0.3s" data-turbolinks-animate-delay="250">I am a link!</a>
```

#### Attributes:

* `data-turbolinks-animate-animation` Animation to be applied when disappearing after a hyperlink got clicked. Accepts a string. Set it to `'false'` to disable turbolinks-animate.js on this specific link.

* `data-turbolinks-animate-appear` Animation to be applied when appearing on the next view after a hyperlink got clicked. Accepts a string.

* `data-turbolinks-animate-duration` CSS value for `animation-duration`. Accepts a string.

* `data-turbolinks-animate-delay` Milliseconds after which animation starts. Accepts an integer or `false`.

### Per Device-Type

In addition you can specify animations specifically for certain screen sizes, just pass a hash:

```javascript
TurbolinksAnimate.init({ animation: { 'mobile': 'fadeinup', 'tablet': 'fadeindown', 'desktop': 'fadein' } });
```

**Note:** You can customize the breakpoints through the [options](#options).

### Overriding animations

A lot of times with frameworks like Ruby on Rails you want to be able to specify animations from within your controllers and views without nasty javascript nesting.

With turbolinks-animate.js you can just add a data attribute to your initialized element, naming the animation you want to use. It will override the global default:

```html
<body data-turbolinks-animate-animation="fadeinup"></body>
```

### Persistent elements

A lot of times you want to persist certain elements throughout requests, for example a navigation bar or other parts of your layout that is being shared between views. turbolinks-animate.js makes it dead simple to declare persistent elements in your view:

```html
<body data-turbolinks-animate-animation="fadein">
    <h1 data-turbolinks-animate-persist="true">My app</h1>
    <p>This is specific to my view!</p>
</body>
```

**Note:** Elements don't actually persist, the get replaced by the fetched page just like any other element. But because no animation gets applied, they look just as if the persist (as long as the newly fetched page includes the exact same element in the same position).

Setting `data-turbolinks-animate-persist` to `true` will result in the entire element (including its children) being excluded from the applied animations. If you want to apply the animations to children of the persistent element, but still keep it untouched, append `-itself` to the data attribute. This is especially useful, when you apply a background color to your element, which remains the same, but changes it contents:

```html
<body data-turbolinks-animate-animation="fadein">
    <nav data-turbolinks-animate-persist-itself="true" style="background: black;">
        <h1 style="color: white;">View specific title</h1>
    </nav>
    <p>This is specific to my view!</p>
</body>
```

### Animation types

Often your permanent elements depend on the hyperlink clicked. Just specify the animation type on the hyperlink tag, and replace `true` with the chosen type on the persistent element:

```html
<body data-turbolinks-animate-animation="fadein">
    <nav data-turbolinks-animate-persist-itself="nav" style="background: black;">
        <h1 style="color: white;">View specific title</h1>
    </nav>
    <a href="/do" data-turbolinks-animate-type="nav">Persist navigation!</a>
    <a href="/doo">Don't persist navigation!</a>
</body>
```

### Events

turbolinks-animate.js emits events that allow you to track the animation lifecycle. turbolinks-animate.js fires events on the `document` object.

* `turbolinks:animation-start` fires when an animation starts. The main turbolinks-animate.js element can be accessed with `event.data.element`. Access the animation with `event.data.animation`. Access whether content appears or disappears with `event.data.disappearing`.

* `turbolinks:animation-end` fires when an animation ends. The main turbolinks-animate.js element can be accessed with `event.data.element`. Access whether content appeared or disappeared with `event.data.disappearing`.
