## Information

**Size:** turbolinks-animate.js takes < 1kb gzipped.

**Dependencies:** [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks), [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css)

---

## Usage

First you need to add [turbolinks-animate.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/turbolinks-animate), and its dependencies to your project, then initialize turbolinks-animate.js:

```javascript
$(document).on( 'turbolinks:load', function() {
    $('body').turbolinksAnimate();
    turbolinksAnimateAppear();
});
$(document).on( 'turbolinks:request-start', function() {
    turbolinksAnimateDisappear();
});
$(window).on( 'popstate', function(event) {
    turbolinksAnimateDisappear();
});
```

**Note:** You can only use `turbolinksAnimate()` for one element at a time.

### Functions

```javascript
// Shows the initialized element
turbolinksAnimateAppear();

// Hides the initialized element
turbolinksAnimateDisappear();
```

### Options

There are a number of ways in which you can adopt turbolinks-animate.js to your needs:

#### Animations

The vital part is choosing an animation to play. turbolinks-animate.js utilizes Animate.css to power them. These are the animations which are currently accessible:

* fadeIn
* fadeInUp
* fadeInDown
* fadeInRight
* fadeInLeft
* fadeOut
* fadeOutUp
* fadeOutDown
* fadeOutRight
* fadeOutLeft

There are three ways in which you can specify the animation you want to use. To choose a globally used animation pass an option when initializing turbolinks-animate.js:

```javascript
$('body').turbolinksAnimate({ animation: 'fadeinright' });
```

**Note:** The option falls back to `fadein`.

**Note:** As a global choice you would only want to use appearing animations, as they will get reversed automatically when the current view disappears.

For alternate approaches take a look at [inline animations](#inline-animations) and animations for [Rails](#rails).

#### Advanced

**duration:** CSS value for `animation-duration`. Accepts a string. Defaults to `0.5s`.

**delay:** Milliseconds after which animation starts. Accepts an integer or `false`. Defaults to `false`.

**reversedDisappearing:** Whether or not a reversed animation should be used when disappearing. Accepts a boolean. Defaults to `true`.

**mobileWidth:** The maximum width of a device to be interpreted as mobile. Accepts an integer or string. Defaults to `'500'`.

**tabletWidth:** The maximum width of a device to be interpreted as a tablet. Accepts an integer or string. Defaults to `'1024'`.

#### Example

```javascript
$('body').turbolinksAnimate({ animation: 'fadeinright', duration: '1s', delay: 1000 });
```

### Inline animations

With turbolinks-animate.js you are able to set animations based on the links, who got clicked:

```html
<a href="" data-turbolinks-animate-animation="fadeout" data-turbolinks-animate-duration="0.3s" data-turbolinks-animate-delay="250">I am a link!</a>
```

### Per Device-Type

In addition you can specify animations specifically for certain screen sizes, just pass a hash:

```javascript
$('body').turbolinksAnimate({ animation: '{"mobile":"fadeinup","tablet":"fadeindown","desktop":"fadein"}', duration: '1s', delay: 1000 });
```

**Note:** At the moment turbolinks-animate.js only supports the three screen sizes `mobile`, `tablet` and `desktop`. You can customize the breakpoints through the [options](#advanced).

When a specific animation for the current screen size has not been given, an animation will be choosen through the following pattern:

* `mobile`
* `tablet`
* `desktop`
* `default` (e.g. a plain string, no hash)

### Overriding animations

A lot of times with frameworks like Ruby on Rails you want to be able to specify animations from within your controllers and views without nasty javascript nesting.

With turbolinks-animate.js you can just add a data attribute to your initialized element, naming the animation you want to use. It will override the global default:

```html
<body data-turbolinks-animate-animation="fadeinup"></body>
```

### Persistent elements

A lot of times you want to persist certain elements throughout requests, for example a navigation bar or other parts of your layout that is being shared between views. turbolinks-animate.js makes it dead simple to declare persistent elements in your view:

```html
<body data-turbolinks-animate-animation="fadein">
    <h1 data-turbolinks-animate-persist="true">My app</h1>
    <p>This is specific to my view!</p>
</body>
```

**Note:** Elements don't actually persist, the get replaced by the fetched page just like any other element. But because no animation gets applied, they look just as if the persist (as long as the newly fetched page includes the exact same element in the same position).

Setting `data-turbolinks-animate-persist` to `true` will result in the entire element (including its children) being excluded from the applied animations. If you want to apply the animations to children of the persistent element, but still keep it untouched, append `-itself` to the data attribute. This is especially useful, when you apply a background color to your element, which remains the same, but changes it contents:

```html
<body data-turbolinks-animate-animation="fadein">
    <nav data-turbolinks-animate-persist-itself="true" style="background: black;">
        <h1 style="color: white;">View specific title</h1>
    </nav>
    <p>This is specific to my view!</p>
</body>
```

### Animation types

Often your permanent elements depend on the hyperlink clicked. Just specify the animation type on the hyperlink tag, and replace `true` with the chosen type on the persistent element:

```html
<body data-turbolinks-animate-animation="fadein">
    <nav data-turbolinks-animate-persist-itself="nav" style="background: black;">
        <h1 style="color: white;">View specific title</h1>
    </nav>
    <a href="/do" data-turbolinks-animate-type="nav">Persist navigation!</a>
    <a href="/doo">Don't persist navigation!</a>
</body>
```
