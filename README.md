## Information

## Usage

First you need to add [turbolinks-animate.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/turbolinks-animate), and its dependencies to your project, then initialize turbolinks-animate.js:

```javascript
document.addEventListener( 'turbolinks:load', function() {
    $('body').turbolinksAnimate();
    turbolinksAnimateAppear();
});
document.addEventListener( 'turbolinks:request-start', function() {
    turbolinksAnimateDisappear();
});
$(window).bind( 'popstate', function(event) {
    turbolinksAnimateDisappear();
});
```

**Note:** You can only use `turbolinksAnimate()` for one element at a time.

### Functions

```javascript
// Shows the initialized element
turbolinksAnimateAppear();

// Hides the initialized element
turbolinksAnimateDisappear();
```

### Options

There are a number of ways in which you can adopt turbolinks-animate.js to your needs:

#### Animations

The vital part is choosing an animation to play. turbolinks-animate.js utilizes Animate.css to power them. These are the animations which are currently accessible:

* fadeIn
* fadeInUp
* fadeInDown
* fadeInRight
* fadeInLeft
* fadeOut
* fadeOutUp
* fadeOutDown
* fadeOutRight
* fadeOutLeft

There are three ways in which you can specify the animation you want to use. To choose a globally used animation pass an option when initializing turbolinks-animate.js:

```javascript
$('body').turbolinksAnimate({ animation: 'fadeinright' });
```

**Note:** The option falls back to `fadein`.

**Note:** As a global choice you would only want to use appearing animations, as they will get reversed automatically when the current view disappears.

For alternate approaches take a look at [inline animations](#inline-animations) and animations for [Rails](#rails).

#### Advanced

**duration:** CSS value for `animation-duration`. Accepts a string. Defaults to `0.5s`.

**delay:** Milliseconds after which animation starts. Accepts an integer or `false`. Defaults to `false`.

**reversedDisappearing:** Whether or not a reversed animation should be used when disappearing. Accepts a boolean. Defaults to `true`.

#### Example

```javascript
$('body').turbolinksAnimate({ animation: 'fadeinright', duration: '1s', delay: 1000 });
```

### Inline animations

With turbolinks-animate.js you are able to set animations based on the links, who got clicked:

```html
<a href="" data-turbolinks-animate-animation="fadeout" data-turbolinks-animate-duration="0.3s" data-turbolinks-animate-delay="250">I am a link!</a>
```

### Per Device-Type

In addition you can specify animations specifically for certain screen sizes, just pass a hash:

```html
<body data-turbolinks-animate-animation="{"mobile":"fadeinup","tablet":"fadeindown","desktop":"fadein"}"></body>
```

**Note:** At the moment turbolinks-animate.js only supports the three screen sizes `mobile`, `tablet` and `desktop`. You can customize the breakpoints through the [options](#advanced).

When a specific animation for the current screen size has not been given, an animation will be choosen through the following pattern:

* `mobile`
* `tablet`
* `desktop`
* `default` (e.g. a plain string, no hash)

### Rails

A lot of times with frameworks like Ruby on Rails you want to be able to specify animations from within your controllers and views without nasty javascript nesting.

With turbolinks-animate.js you can just add a class to your initialized element, naming the animation you want to use. It will override the global default:

```html
<body class="turbolinks-animate--fadeinup"></body>
```
